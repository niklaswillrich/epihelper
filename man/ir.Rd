\title{Calculate table for incidence data}
\usage{
ir(data, case.var, exposure.var, time.var, output = "plain", digits = 2,
  alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame we are working on}

\item{output}{type of table output ( e.g. "plain", "html")}

\item{digits}{number of digits to show after the decimal point}

\item{cases}{string of case variable}

\item{exposure}{string of exposure variable}

\item{time}{time at risk for subjects}
}
\value{
a list of tables of results and statistics
   \itemize{
   \item table: contains table of cases, time at risk and incidence
         split along category exposed/unexposed.
   \item stats: contains difference of ir between exposed/unexposed,
   ir ratios between exposed/unexposed, attributable fraction exposed
   and attributable fraction of population.
   }
   If option output = "html" is chosen, then no return but html
   tables are printed. The default output="plain" returns two matrices with
   the results for further processing.
}
\description{
This function gives a table of results for incidence data.
The results are comparable to the ir function in Stata.
